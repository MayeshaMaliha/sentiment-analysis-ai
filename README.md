# sentiment-analysis-ai
To develop a machine learning model that analyzes the sentiment of IMDB movie reviews and accurately classifies them as positive or negative.

# Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based sentiment analysis system to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. The model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and applies both traditional and advanced machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification.

The project showcases a complete pipeline, including exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Using state-of-the-art tools like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and the Hugging Face Transformers library, the system achieves high accuracy in sentiment prediction.

To make the tool accessible, the model is deployed as an interactive web application where users can input reviews and get real-time predictions. This project demonstrates the real-world application of sentiment analysis in understanding customer feedback, monitoring brand perception, and analyzing public opinions.

# Key Features:

Clean and modular code for reproducibility.
Pretrained transformer models for improved accuracy.
A user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit/Flask.

# Outcome:
A functional sentiment analysis AI with an accuracy of over 85% on test data and an interactive demo application.
